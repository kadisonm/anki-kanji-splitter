- Finish writing README features and installation instructions
- Write Anki add-on post
- Fix the awful CSS
- Add an undo to scanning the deck that uses Anki internally
- When sorting set the first card to the next new card timestamp and build up from there. This should avoid duplicate timestamps.
- Switch the default deck internally instead of through unreliable method
- Add CSS to make the user able to change text colour to highlight components and keyword in the mnemonic.
- Remove irreversible message from mnemonic
- Some keywords are out of date with JPDB due to the original list being old
- investigate some kanji not being broken down properly
- When editing a mnemonic fill the existing textbox with that mnemonic
- Show keyword for each component in kanji's component list (might need to use JS api)
- Build a card editor that can allow sections to be dragged around and placed wherever the user would like
