- Finish writing README features and installation instructions
- Write Anki add-on post
- Fix the awful CSS
- Add an undo to scanning the deck that uses Anki internally and update settings
- When sorting set the first card to the next new card timestamp and build up from there. This should avoid duplicate timestamps.
- Switch the default deck internally instead of through unreliable method
- Remove irreversible message from mnemonic
- Some keywords are out of date with JPDB due to the original list being old
- investigate some kanji not being broken down properly
- Show keyword for each component in kanji's component list (might need to use JS api)
- Build a card editor that can allow sections to be dragged around and placed wherever the user would like
- Make editing keyword and mnemonic editable within the note (turn the edit button into a tick and add a caret)
- 乡 could not find the Kanji VG
- Settings image isnt loading
