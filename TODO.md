# Kanji
- ç«œ adds itself as a component. Make sure to check this
- Kanji components are being added from right to left. Check this

# Keywords
- Some keywords are out of date with JPDB due to the original list being old (maybe introduce a way for me to rescrape it for updates)
- Show keyword for each component in kanji's component list (might need to use JS api)

# Keyboard Shortcuts
- Fix keyboard shortcuts to actually use the range of the selection and not just replace all the words
- Add being able to use a shortcut to remove highlights
