- Finish writing README features and installation instructions
- Write Anki add-on post
- Fix the awful CSS
- Add an undo to scanning the deck that uses Anki internally and update settings
- When sorting set the first card to the next new card timestamp and build up from there. This should avoid duplicate timestamps.
- Switch the default deck internally instead of through unreliable method
- Some keywords are out of date with JPDB due to the original list being old (maybe introduce a way to rescrape it for updates)
- Show keyword for each component in kanji's component list (might need to use JS api)
- Build a card editor that can allow sections to be dragged around and placed wherever the user would like
- 乡 could not find the Kanji VG
- Settings image isnt loading (couldn't find a way to reproduce it)
- scanning a deck with due cards made them all invalid date??
- Add a grid to the drawing canvas

- Figure out why in 至 that 厶 was skipped
- Figure out how to get kanji like 𡗗 to have a stroke diagram

- Remove option for watching sub decks - Complicates reviews too much (maybe, check if it work stil)

- Get having multiple cards working, make sure subnotes are added to the right card
