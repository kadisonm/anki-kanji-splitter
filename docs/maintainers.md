New releases will appear as a draft [here](https://github.com/kadisonm/anki-kanji-splitter/releases).

Ensure the tag and title is set with the version correctly formatted. For alpha versions ensure pre-release is enabled.

### Semantic Versioning Format

For release versions use:

`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

For beta versions use:

Do not inclease a `v` prefix.
